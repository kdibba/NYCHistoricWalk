# üï∞Ô∏è HistoricOverlay ‚Äì AR Time Travel Through NYC

HistoricOverlay is a mobile AR app built with **Expo** and **Moondream**, designed to let users explore the past by simply pointing their phone at a building. With lightweight on-device inference and NYC historical image matching, the app overlays 1940s photos on top of live camera views in real time.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üì¶ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the development server

```bash
